            <p class="text">
                The travel industry has been slowly but surely rebounding since the COVID-19 pandemic stopped life — and adventure — in its tracks. As more countries continue to ease COVID-19 restrictions, 
                tour operators around the globe have been seeing an increase in interest, demand, and bookings. The adventure tourism sector, however, are seeing more significant
                growth than other niche markets within the tourism industry. This is partly because many governments shut down sports and other organized activities during the pandemic 
                lockdowns. As a result, this left many individuals feeling frustrated, socially isolated, and disconnected from nature. Many travelers are 
                ready to live life to the fullest once again.
                <br>
                <br>
                In particular, experts predict that outdoor adventure travel opportunities will be in 
                high demand among travelers within the next coming years. For starters, many people who are slowly beginning to travel again are setting their sights on 
                outdoor activities. This is due to the lower risk of COVID-19 transmission in outdoor settings. In addition, the realities of the pandemic have forced people 
                to focus on their priorities again. Many have found that being outdoors is not only good for their 
                physical health but their emotional health as well.

                Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in 
                Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a 
                favoured mode of transport (from home to office and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, 
                besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise. In cities, bikes help lessen traffic congestion and assist in solving seemingly perennial parking problems, as well as offering easier manoeuvrability. The bike, then, has plenty of things going for 
                it it's kinder to the environment; it costs little to buy, operate and maintain; it is incredibly convenient to own; and it is the ideal way to fitness. All of these factors contribute towards making cycling a fun and enjoyable activity.
                <br><br>                
                There are three types of cycling: Utility, recreational 
                (touring, organized rides, mountain) and racing.

                Paragliding appeals to both walkers and rock climbers, as paragliders are compact, can be rolled in a 
                backpack and at the end of the day can be made ready for a flight down the mountains. It also caters to pilots, 
                because you can ride thermal currents and stay in the air perpetually, like a sailplane or a hang glider.

                Go it alone or hop on and go tandem. Learn to hang glideat the Freedom Flight school. Whatever your level, 
                the certified instructors and top notch equipment will get you higher. They have large slow flying training gliders,

                Canada is the second-largest country in the world and has the largest 
                coastline in the world, with 
                202,080 kilometers (125,566 miles) of shores.
                Canada also hides a few inland secrets with unusual river waves and stunning tidal bores 
                blooming near gorges and canyons that should 
                definitely be visited and experienced.
                If you're visiting Canada and plan to surf, make sure to pack a 6/5/4 mm wetsuit, 
                as well as neoprene gloves, boots, and hoods.
